=== Overview

You can use several tools to install Ruby. This page describes how to install Ruby in Linux, macOS or Windows.

=== Install via RVM

RVM supports most UNIX like systems and Windows (with Cygwin or Bash on Ubuntu on Windows).
The basic requirements are `bash`, `curl`, `gpg2` and overall GNU version of tools - but RVM tries to autodetect it and install anything that is needed.

===== Install GPG keys

As a first step install mpapis public key used to verify installation package to ensure security.

```shell
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
```

===== Basic Install

```shell
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```

==== Install via rbenv

```shell
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
```

```shell
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

===== Install Ruby

```shell
rbenv install -l
```
